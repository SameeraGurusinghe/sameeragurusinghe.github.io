                  The Covid 19 virus, which started in 2019 and spread worldwide, has claimed many lives. The World Health Organization (WHO) has introduced a set of rules and regulations for countries around the world to prevent such deaths as well as the spread of disease. Our project is to examine some of those given rules. It was suggested that a face mask be worn first, as the virus spreads through the mouth. Going through that, this project will have to test whether it is worn correctly. That is, before entering a place, the mask is checked to see if it is worn properly. The system checks that the mouth and nose are properly covered. Also, there were no specific drugs for this Covid-19 virus. The virus was also difficult to control as it varied into different strains. But during the outbreak, doctors did a lot of testing to control it, introducing several vaccines that were considered the best and quickest way to control the virus. They said the vaccine had been developed to reduce the risk of infection. People who are vaccinated at the time of vaccination are given a vaccination card. The card states the date of vaccination and what the vaccine is. Therefore, this research can be used to automatically test it when entering a public place using it for our project. The system allows you to take a photo of the card and analyze the data on it. There only the card is placed and the data in it, i.e. It checks the date it was received, and whether it has been fully vaccinated in a timely manner. Our research examines those issues and can use this system when entering a public place. This system will make some contribution to prevent the spread of Covid 19 virus.
